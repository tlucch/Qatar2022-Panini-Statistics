# Qatar2022-Panini-Statistics
A set of simulation that show how much stickers are needed to complete the Qatar 2022 Panini Album

## No Training

The "No training" code generates 1000 simluations in which each person can't trade stickers with other people. The code iterates imitating a person that buys stickers until the ablum is full and counts how many stickers were needed to buy in other to complete the album. After that an histogram is made, in order to see the distribution, and the mean and standard deviations are printed.
